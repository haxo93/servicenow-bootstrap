# ServiceNow Bootstrap Enhancement Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Enhancement of the existing self-hosted ServiceNow instance builder for AWS, focusing on automation, flexibility, and user interface improvements.

### 1.2 Current System
The existing system successfully builds self-hosted ServiceNow instances with the following characteristics:

- Manual script copying
- Limited automation in EC2 instance deployment

### 1.3 Enhancement Goals
- Support multiple ServiceNow versions
- Automate EC2 instance deployment and configuration
- Create web-based management interface
- Establish robust build and deployment process

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Version Support
- Support for ServiceNow Xanadu and Washington DC versions
- Version-specific configuration management
- Java version management per ServiceNow version
- Configuration file management for different versions

### 2.2 AWS Integration
- Automated EC2 instance deployment (t3.large)
- Support for both new builds and snapshot-based deployments
- Instance deletion capability
- Pre-configured database volume snapshot management
- Target group health verification

### 2.3 Build Process
- GitHub integration for code deployment
- Automated validation checks
- Build status monitoring
- Build process notifications
- File presence validation
- Target group health monitoring

### 2.4 User Interface
